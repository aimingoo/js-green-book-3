# node-mock-stdin

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/caitp/node-mock-stdin.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/caitp/node-mock-stdin) [![Coverage Status](https://img.shields.io/coveralls/caitp/node-mock-stdin.svg)](https://coveralls.io/r/caitp/node-mock-stdin?branch=master) [![NPM Version](http://img.shields.io/npm/v/mock-stdin.svg)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/mock-stdin)

Provide a mock readable stream, useful for testing interactive CLI applications.

Maybe simple mocks for other standard files wouldn't be a terrible idea, if anyone
feels like those are needed. Patches welcome.

## API

- **Module**
  - [stdin()](#modulestdin)
- **MockSTDIN**
  - [send()](#mockstdinsenddata-encoding)
  - [end()](#mockstdinend)
  - [restore()](#mockstdinrestore)
  - [reset()](#mockstdinresetremovelisteners)

---

### Module.stdin()

**example**

```js
require('mock-stdin').stdin();
```

Replaces the existing `process.stdin` value with a mock object exposing a `send` method (a
`MockSTDIN` instance). This allows APIs like `process.openStdin()` or `process.stdin.on()`
to operate on a mock instance.

**note**: Event listeners from the original `process.stdin` instance are not added to the
mock instance. Installation of the mock should occur before any event listeners are
registered.

**return value**: A `MockSTDIN` instance

---

### MockSTDIN.send(data, encoding)

**example**

```js
var stdin = require('mock-stdin').stdin();
stdin.send("Some text", "ascii");
stdin.send(Buffer("Some text", "Some optional encoding"));
stdin.send([
  "Array of lines",
  "  which are joined with a linefeed."
]);

// sending a null will trigger EOF and dispatch an 'end' event.
stdin.send(null);
```

Queue up data to be read by the stream. Results in data (and possibly end) events being 
dispatched.

**parameters**
  - `data`: A `String`, `Buffer`, `Array<String>`, or `null`. The `data` parameter will result in
    the default encoding if specified as a string or array of strings.
  - `encoding`: An optional encoding which is used when `data` is a `String`.
      Node.js's internal Readable Stream will convert the specified encoding into the output
      encoding, which is transcoded if necessary.

**return value**: The `MockSTDIN` instance, for chaining.

---

### MockSTDIN.end()

**example**

```js
var stdin = require('mock-stdin').stdin();
stdin.end();
```

Alias for [MockSTDIN.send(null)](#mockstdinsend). Results in dispatching an `end` event.

**return value**: The `MockSTDIN` instance, for chaining.

---

### MockSTDIN.restore()

**example**

```js
var stdin = require('mock-stdin').stdin();
// process.stdin is now a mock stream
stdin.restore();
// process.stdin is returned to its original state
```

Restore the target of the mocked stream. If only a single mock stream is created, will restore
the original `stdin` TTY stream. If multiple mock streams are created, it will restore the
stream which was active at the time the mock was created.

**return value**: The `MockSTDIN` instance, for chaining.

---

### MockSTDIN.reset(removeListeners)

**example**

```js
var stdin = require('mock-stdin').stdin();
stdin.end();
stdin.reset();
stdin.send("some data");
```

Ordinarily, a Readable stream will throw when attempting to push after an EOF. This routine will
reset the `ended` state of a Readable stream, preventing it from throwing post-EOF. This prevents
being required to re-create a mock STDIN instance during certain tests where a fresh stdin is
required.

If the `removeListeners` flag is set to `true`, all event listeners will also be reset. This is
useful in cases where you need to emulate restarting an entire application, without fully 
re-creating the mock object.

**parameters**
  - `removeListeners`: Boolean value which, when set to `true`, will remove all event listeners
  attached to the stream.

**return value**: The `MockSTDIN` instance, for chaining.
